This is an old malware gdi of mine made in C#
but now I make it public.
It was created for nFire an Italian Cybersecurity YouTube channel, it was created by me in C# and the mbr in Asm.
Features? Os detection from Windows 10 onwards, gdi, bytebeat, destruction of regedit and system32 (does not work correctly), in the version with 4 mbr using Random decides which mbr to execute of the 4.
What changes between these versions and the one you saw on my channel?
The duration since 10 minutes of gdi quite broken was boring so I made 2 versions:
a version that has 4 different mbr and lasts less than the one shown on the channel and another that lasts less with the same payloads and only one mbr.
